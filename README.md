**Fake News Prediction using Logistic Regression üì∞**

This project implements a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of news headlines/articles and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

**Tech Stack**

Python

scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

**Project Overview**

Fake news has become a major challenge in today‚Äôs digital world. This project builds a supervised learning model to detect fake news articles using Logistic Regression.

Steps followed:

1.Dataset loading & cleaning

2.Text preprocessing 

3.Model training with Logistic Regression

4.Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

**Dataset**

The dataset contains labeled news articles with ‚Äúreal‚Äù and ‚Äúfake‚Äù classes.

 Used dataset: Fake News Dataset from Kaggle

You can also replace with any custom dataset of news articles.
