# 📰 Fake News Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project implements a **machine learning model** to classify news articles as **real or fake** using **Logistic Regression**.  
It applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction before training the model.



## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  



##  Project Overview
Fake news has become a major challenge in today’s digital era. This project builds a **supervised learning model** that can detect fake news articles using Logistic Regression.  

### Steps Implemented:
1. **Dataset Loading & Cleaning** – Importing and preprocessing labeled data.  
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF/CountVectorizer).  
3. **Model Training** – Building a Logistic Regression classifier.  
4. **Evaluation** – Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  



## 📂 Dataset
- Used dataset: [Fake News Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news)  
- Contains labeled news articles with **“real”** and **“fake”** classes.  
- You can also replace it with any custom dataset of news articles.
